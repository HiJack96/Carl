# Carl
Carl is a psuedo-ai that I have developed and will continue to work on.

So far, he does well with mocking a conversation, but he needs a lot of input in order to do so.

If you look through the code, you will see three main sections with the middle section containing three more subsections. 
The sections go as follows: Creation, Conversation, and Memorization.
Creation: the first section is where all of the necessary variables are created and reloaded.
Conversation: This is a while statement where Carl will constantly talk with the user until the user says "goodbye"
Memorization:: After the user says goodbye, Carl commits to memory what he learned during the conversation.

Within the conversation section, you will find three subsections: Memorizing, Searching, and Responding.
Memorizing: Carl takes in what he said (output) and what the user said (input) and commits it to memory (or increases the frequency if he already knows the pair).
Searching: This is where Carl searches for the most popular way to respond to a given input.
Responding: This is where Carl blurts out what he found and then requires a response (input) from the user.

If you use Carl, please send me a copy of his Memory.sav file. I will compile all compies into one file for everyone to use.
Let me know if you think of any improvements I can make. Thank you! -Jack
